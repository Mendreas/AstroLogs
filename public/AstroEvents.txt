Additional Notable Events

🪐 Saturn’s Rings "Disappear" (Ring Plane Crossing)
What: On March 23, 2025 at 16:04 UTC, Earth will pass through Saturn’s ring plane. The rings will appear edge-on and nearly vanish from our perspective—an event that happens roughly every 13–14 years 

Observation notes:

The exact alignment (“ring plane crossing”) peaks on March 23, 2025 at 16:04 UTC

.

The phenomenon makes Saturn appear almost “ringless,” though the planet will be too close to the Sun to observe directly at that moment 

Saturn’s rings will gradually re-emerge, reaching their narrowest visible tilt again on November 23, 2025 

🌌 Solar Maximum & Increased Aurora Activity
What’s happening: The Solar Cycle 25 peak occurs in July 2025, but solar activity starts ramping up well before and afterwards 

Aurora outlook:

Due to the solar maximum, auroras are expected to be stronger and more frequent, possibly visible at lower latitudes than usual—including sporadically across northern Europe 

March 2025 is anticipated as a particularly active month—geomagnetic events around the spring equinox increase incidence of auroral displays .

Timeline:

Ongoing throughout 2025, with the peak likely in July, though strong activity may continue into early 2026 .

Example: A moderate G2–G3 geomagnetic storm is forecast for June 14–15, 2025, potentially visible in northern Europe

🌞 Solar Maximum Aftermath & Aurora Potential
Context: Solar Cycle 25 peaked in July 2025; in 2026, geomagnetic activity remains elevated.

Implications: Increased likelihood of auroral displays at mid‑northern latitudes. Portugal may occasionally view auroras, especially during geomagnetic storms in spring/fall equinox periods.
